year = {2017},
abstract = {One major task in business process management is that of aligning real process execution traces to a process model by (minimally) introducing and eliminating steps. Here, we look at declarative process specifications expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf). We provide a sound and complete technique to synthesize the alignment instructions relying on finite automata theoretic manipulations. Such a technique can be effectively implemented by using planning technology. Notably, the resulting planning-based alignment system significantly outperforms all current state-of-the-art ad-hoc alignment systems. We report an in-depth experimental study that supports this claim.},

abstract="Process mining techniques often reveal that real-life processes are more variable than anticipated. Although declarative process models are more suitable for less structured processes, most discovery techniques generate conventional procedural models. In this paper, we focus on discovering Declare models based on event logs. A Declare model is composed of temporal constraints. Despite the suitability of declarative process models for less structured processes, their discovery is far from trivial. Even for smaller processes there are many potential constraints. Moreover, there may be many constraints that are trivially true and that do not characterize the process well. Naively checking all possible constraints is computationally intractable and may lead to models with an excessive number of constraints. Therefore, we have developed an Apriori algorithm to reduce the search space. Moreover, we use new metrics to prune the model. As a result, we can quickly generate understandable Declare models for real-life event logs.",

  title={Discovering Declarative Process Model Behavior from Event Logs via Model Learning},

  year={2021},

  volume={},

  number={},

  pages={48-55},

  abstract={Declarative business process (BP) models define the behavior of BPs as a set of temporal constraints, which can be summarized as a deterministic finite state automaton (DFA). Declarative BP discovery aims at inferring such constraints from event logs. To this aim, it requires as additional input the set of candidate constraints to be verified with respect to the event log. Intuitively, this restricts the discovery task to a conformance checking activity between a predefined set of constraint templates and an event log, preventing to learn any observed behavior that is not captured by those templates. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage Model Learning (ML) for the automated discovery of the DFA underlying the behavior of a declarative BP model, without using any further a-priori information in addition to the event log. To assess the quality of the discovered DFA, we introduce a novel definition of the standard process mining quality metrics, i.e., precision, generalization and simplicity, tailored to DFAs. Finally, a preliminary evaluation performed with real-life logs shows that ML enables to generate extremely simpler DFAs than state-of-the-art BP declarative discovery techniques, keeping similar values of precision and generalization.},

@article{ltlfnfa, title={Reasoning on LTL on Finite Traces: Insensitivity to Infiniteness}, volume={28}, abstractNote={ &lt;p&gt; In this paper we study when an LTL formula on finite traces (LTLf formula) is insensitive to infiniteness, that is, it can be correctly handled as a formula on infinite traces under the assumption that at a certain point the infinite trace starts repeating an end event forever, trivializing all other propositions to false. This intuition has been put forward and (wrongly) assumed to hold in general in the literature. We define a necessary and sufficient condition to characterize whether an LTLf formula is insensitive to infiniteness, which can be automatically checked by any LTL reasoner. Then, we show that typical LTLf specification patterns used in process and service modeling in CS, as well as trajectory constraints in Planning and transition-based LTLf specifications of action domains in KR, are indeed very often insensitive to infiniteness. This may help to explain why the assumption of interpreting LTL on finite and on infinite traces has been (wrongly) blurred. Possibly because of this blurring, virtually all literature detours to Buechi automata for constructing the NFA that accepts the traces satisfying an LTLf formula. As a further contribution, we give a simple direct algorithm for computing such NFA. &lt;/p&gt; }, number={1}, journal={AAAI}, author={De Giacomo, Giuseppe and De Masellis, Riccardo and Montali, Marco}, year={2014}, month={Jun.} }

	abstract="Smart contracts are programs deployed on blockchains that automatically execute when some conditions are verified to satisfy the terms of an agreement. They are usually programmed in procedural languages even if some recent proposals use logic for their specification and verification. However, existing logic-based initiatives only enable the formal checking of properties of a single smart contract independently from the other smart contracts running on the same blockchain. This paper proposes a framework, called SCRea, that works on a set of smart contracts encoded in Linear Temporal Logics. SCRea can work offline or at runtime to verify whether the execution of each smart contract is compatible with the execution of the others and, in case, provides a particular order of execution ensuring that the preconditions of each smart contract are verified before its execution.",
